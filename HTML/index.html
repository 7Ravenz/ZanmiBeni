                                    These children, many of whom were disabled, orphaned, or abused, were living in a single ward at the General Hospital
                                    in Port-au-Prince, (Hôpital de l’Universite d’Etat d’Haiti, or HUEH).  The children, many of whom had lived at the hospital
                                    ward for years, had been abandoned or had been left at the hospital by parents who were, sadly, unable to care for them. Pre-earthquake
                                    living conditions for the children were less than optimal, but when the quake hit, the building suffered severe damage and the already-overtaxed 
                                    hospital staff, overwhelmed with throngs of severely injured people, were unable to even provide basic care for the children.  When Paul Farmer, 
                                    Loune Viaud and Nancy Dorsinville arrived at the hospital a few days after the earthquake, they found the children alone, hungry, frightened and surrounded by chaos, injury, 
                                    disease, and death.  It was apparent that something had to be done immediately to protect these children, and that it would be necessary to secure a safe and permanent home as soon as possible.</span>

                                        It seemed almost miraculous when, in the midst of the devastation of the earthquake,  Loune Viaud found a beautiful, sprawling property for sale just outside Port-au-Prince. Paul Farmer had recently celebrated his fiftieth birthday and generously donated the funds that were given to him as a birthday gift to help purchase the property. Partners In Health and Zanmi Lasante then formed a partnership with Operation Blessing, and together these three international organizations moved quickly and decisively to develop a plan to convert the property into an appropriate and high-quality living environment with the necessary accommodations for the children with disabilities. Existing buildings on the property were renovated, and new buildings were designed to meet the needs of the growing community.  Staff was hired and trained, programs and daily schedules were created, and due to the yeoman’s efforts of a small group of dedicated people, the children were settled in their new home within four months.  In the year following the earthquake, other orphaned, displaced, and abandoned children have joined the original group, bringing the total number of children in the Zanmi Beni community to sixty-four. Zanmi Beni, the name chosen for the community, means “Blessed Friends” in Haiti Creole. Indeed, all who are associated with the children of Zanmi Beni feel blessed to be a part of this beautiful and hopeful place.

                        “Although few displaced by the quake had the good fortune to end up under a real roof, among them were a group of unaccompanied minors we’d come across in the General Hospital. Loune Viaud has been looking after them since the quake. With the help of my Petionville host, Maryse, Loune sealed the deal on a property in northern Port-au-Prince, on the fringes of the quake zone. The place soon became a veritable oasis: a house full of kids and nurses surrounded by a few acres of well-tended land, lush with mangoes and other fruit trees. The place was christened Zanmi Beni – “ Blessed Friends” – and became an oasis both for the children and for a handful of displaced health professionals and volunteers.”

                      We believe caring for vulnerable children is our moral responsibility, and that all children are entitled to live with dignity and access to the goods and services that make human flourishing possible.
                      We believe in an inclusive, family-based care model where in which each child is known and loved for who they uniquely are and each child has the opportunity to form long-term, loving relationships with adults and their peers.
                      We strive to maintain a focus on gender equity and to create an atmosphere where tolerance, dignity, respect, and love prevail.
                      We practice the “accompaniment” model by providing permanent access to food, shelter, medical services, education and companionship.
                      We promote a positive view of disability in which each child is recognized as a person with rights and has access to full inclusion in all of life’s major activities.
                      We are committed to developing on-site programs that will help to create sustainability by generating income and offer opportunities for self-sufficiency through job training and employment for the Zanmi Beni residents and staff.
                      We believe in developing long-term partnerships with the local government, the private sector, and committed individuals to support the implementation of our mission.

Once everyone is assembled, the speakers jump to life and the ground rumbles with jubilant West African Highlife songs, the setting sunlight tinting us with its rosy glow. As the pizzicato guitar riffs echo across the compound, the able-bodied kids start to jump and dance; the others sway in their wheelchairs, bathed in the ecstatic music, free from their hospital memories. A group of four teenage girls breaks from the rest of the dancers and we form a semi-circle around them, clapping as they leap through their intricate steps, hands folded behind their heads, hips gyrating with the jubilant music, their long hair swaying through the rosy sky. As we all lose ourselves in the dance, two older boys, Esmane and Stanley, jump onto the dance floor. They dance and dance in an exaggerated imitation of the girls’ choreographed dance, their hands behind their heads, their hips gyrating, their long arms stretched forward, their chests puffing out, seized with joy. The lampooned girls fall upon each other, clutching their sides, howling with laughter. The music flows on. The able, the disabled, the lost, those who have lost, all dance together into the night.”

                                    Partners In Health (PIH) is a Boston based nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide a preferential option for the poor in health care. By establishing long-term relationships with sister organizations based in settings of poverty, Partners In Health strives to achieve two overarching goals: to bring the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them and to serve as an antidote to despair.
